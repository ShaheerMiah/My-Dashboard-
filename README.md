👋 Hi there! I’m Shaheer, an aspiring data analyst with a passion for unravelling insights from complex datasets. My journey involves turning raw data into actionable knowledge, and I’m excited to share my projects and experiences. This GitHub repository showcases my projects across various tools and technologies. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas! 

## About Me 🎓 


Over the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience across several IT roles through my apprenticeship, including cloud engineering, service desk support, onsite engineering, and networking. These roles helped me build a strong foundation in IT and develop key transferable skills that are crucial for a data analyst role. I’ve honed my communication skills, learned to work independently, and consistently met service-level agreements (SLAs). Additionally, I understand stakeholder needs and am dedicated to meeting client expectations, all of which are vital skills for collaborating in data roles. This resulted in me persuing  my passion for data by enrolling into a Just IT Data Bootcamp to further my future career.

📊 Proficient in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn). 
🧩 Skilled in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modelling. 
🌐 Curious about web scraping and API integration. 

## Projects

### Tableau
- **Project Name**: [British Airways Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/4R9QQF6H8?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bdf0345-1830-44d3-a0d1-b0aa3fe56288)
)
  - **Description**: This Tableau project provides a detailed analysis of customer reviews and ratings for British Airways, offering insights into various aspects of passenger satisfaction. The dashboard is divided into several key components:

Summary Metrics: At the top of the dashboard, key performance indicators (KPIs) summarise average ratings across multiple dimensions:

Overall Rating (4.2)
Cabin Staff Service (3.3)
Entertainment (1.4)
Food and Beverages (2.4)
Seat Comfort (2.9)
Value for Money (2.8)
Ground Service (3.0)
Average Overall Rating by Month: A time series line chart visualizes the trend of overall ratings over time, from 2017 to 2023. This highlights fluctuations in customer satisfaction month by month.

Average Overall Rating by Country: A world map uses a heatmap style to display the average overall rating by country, providing a geographical breakdown of passenger satisfaction.

Average Overall Rating by Aircraft: A bar chart illustrates the average ratings for different aircraft types, such as the Boeing 747-400, Boeing 787, and Airbus A380, alongside the number of reviews for each aircraft. This helps identify which aircraft models are preferred by passengers.

Filter Options: Users can interact with the dashboard by applying various filters, including:

Metrics (e.g., Overall Rating, Cabin Staff Service)
Date Range
Traveller Type (e.g., Business, Economy)
Seat Type
Aircraft Type
Continent
This Tableau project provides actionable insights for British Airways to improve their services based on customer feedback trends. It is particularly useful for identifying strengths and weaknesses across different customer segments, regions, and aircraft types.
  - **Technologies Used**: I have used Live Datasets to Visualise this project in a non-technical format to present to stakeholders.
